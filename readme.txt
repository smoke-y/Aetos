According to the myth, Aëtos was a beautiful boy born of the earth. While Zeus was young and hiding in Crete from his father Cronus who had devoured all of Zeus's siblings, Aëtos became friends with the god and was the first one to swear fealty to him as new king. But years later, after Zeus had overthrown his father and become king in his place, Zeus's wife Hera turned Aëtos into an eagle, out of fear that Zeus loved him. Thus the eagle became the sacred bird of Zeus, and a symbol of power and kingship

Aetos is a VM written in my programming language, Zeus(https://github.com/smoke-y/Zeus). This will be dynamically linked to the Zeus compiler to provide compile time execution.

1) Compile Zeus compiler using a cxx compiler
2) Use the Zeus compiler to compiler Aetos VM to a dynamic library
3) The Zeus compiler can now load the dynamic library to provide compile time execution, when compiling later Zeus files
4) Profit
